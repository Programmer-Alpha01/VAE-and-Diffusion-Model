This repository hosts the source code for my COMP 4570SEF Capstone Computing Project, completed as the final-year project for the course.

The project explores advanced generative modeling techniques in deep learning, with a focus on two state-of-the-art approaches: Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Diffusion Models. The implementations provided here correspond directly to the models designed, trained, and evaluated in the accompanying project report.

**Key Contents**
- Complete PyTorch implementations of a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for latent space learning and generative tasks.
- A Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) implementation, including sampling and training pipelines.
- Training and evaluation scripts, configuration files, and Jupyter notebooks for experiments and visualization.
- Pre-trained model checkpoints (where applicable) and sample generated outputs.
This codebase serves as a practical demonstration of the theoretical concepts, architectural design choices, and empirical results discussed in the full project report. It is intended both as a record of the capstone work and as a reusable reference for anyone interested in VAEs, diffusion models, or generative AI techniques.


Feel free to explore the code, run the experiments, or adapt the implementations for your own projects. Contributions, suggestions, and issues are welcome!
